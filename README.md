# üìñ Overview
A minimalist 3D game engine using raycasting technology to project a first-person perspective of a dynamically generated maze. Built from scratch in C using the MLX42 graphics library, this project demonstrates core principles of computer graphics and low-level system programming. 

# üéÆ Features
Custom map system with .cub file parsing:

Wall textures (png files)

flashlight if both the ceiling and floor are black (F to toggle on and off);

Floor/ceiling colors (RGB values)

Player spawn position/direction (N, E, S, W)

# Raycasting engine:

DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm for efficient wall detection

Dynamic wall height calculation based on player distance

# Interactive controls:

WASD movement

R to reload gun.

Mouse/arrow key camera rotation

F to toggle flashlight on and off (only works if the value of the floor and ceiling are 0)

SPACE BAR to open and close doors (need to be close and looking at the door)

LEFT_SHIFT to sprint

ESC to exit

# Advanced graphics:

Gun animation system (idle/walk/reload/fire states)

Sprite sheet sequencing

Texture mapping

Minimap overlay

Door interaction system

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

clone repo

cd cub3d
make bonus

# üïπÔ∏è Usage

./cub3d_bonus maps/jerda.cub

# üó∫Ô∏è MAP:

The SO NO WE EA image paths are used as the texture for the wall facing the specified direction ( south north west east)
F is the rgb color for the floor
C is the rgb color for the ceiling

1 is a wall 0 is a walkable space

D is a closed door

N S E W is the poisition of the player and the direction he is facing (north south east west)

spaces can be added to the map to create complex shapes


This is an example of a valid map:

F 0,0,0
C 0,0,0
